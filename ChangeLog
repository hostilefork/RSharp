v0.6.0, 09-09-2003
------------------

* Changes :

    - New garbage collector and memory manager.
        - Mark&Sweep collector
        - Memory model simplified
        - Previous memory issues solved (leaking, limitations)    
            
    - Interpreter major refactoring:
        - FSM cleaned up and extended
        - Correct error! propagation and catching ('try)
        - Faster main loop execution
        
* Additions :

    - General path! and set-path! evaluation supported with unlimited depth.
      Currently supported datatypes combinations are :
        
        o any-block!/integer!
        o any-block!/get-word!    (word pointing to an integer!)
        o any-string!/integer!
        o any-string!/get-word!    (word pointing to an integer!)
    
    - Exception handling implemented (try, catch, throws, named throws)

    - New native: value?
    - New native: unset
    - New native: until
    - New native: while
    - New native: break
    - New native: catch
    - New native: throw
    - New native: any
    - New native: all
    - New native: return
    - New native: try
    - New native: error?
    - New native: exit
    - New native: uppercase        (contribution from Volker Nitsch)
    - New native: lowercase     (       "        "    "      "   )

    - New definition: forall
    - New definition: attempt
    - New definition: last

* Bugfixes :

    - Experimental change in words evaluating to series! => new value allocated each time.
      (Fixes the 'reduce [a next a] class of bugs, but increase memory usage)

    - copy/part now works well with series! /part argument (due to the change in word evaluation)

    - Fix in words lookup in contexts (wrong result in some rare cases).
    


v0.5.1, 15-07-2003
------------------

* Additions :

    - New refinement : /only for 'insert native
    
    - New words added to global context:
            o any-word!
            o any-string!
            o any-block!
    
    - New native: set
    - New native: get
    - New native: copy    (/deep not supported)
    - New native: zero?
    - New native: not
    
    - New native: equal?
    - New native: strict-equal?
    - New native: same?
    - New native: not-equal?
    - New native: lesser?
    - New native: lesser-or-equal?
    - New native: greater?
    - New native: greater-or-equal?
    
    - New operator: =
    - New operator: ==
    - New operator: =?
    - New operator: <>
    - New operator: <
    - New operator: <=
    - New operator: >
    - New operator: >=

    - New: temporary new mezzanine definitions :

        integer?, block?, char?, datatype?, error?, function?,
        none?, logic?, unset?, native?, op?, paren?, path?,
        refinement?, string?, word?
            
        first, second, third, fourth, fifth        (support series! only)
        
* BugFixes:

    - 'insert now works correctly with char! values.
    - 'insert/dup doesn't crash anymore on negative count values.
    - 'false evaluation was printing true on console. (bug introduced in release version ;-( )

* Misc :

    - integer! values will now correctly report errors when they can't be created.
    - integer! math operations now signals overflows (except for multiplication)

    - better ANSI compatibility
    - added separate files for OS specific code.
