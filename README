Memory is managed automatically by R#.

The new memory handler and GC are more accurate, reliable and stable than the previous ones. In the current version, the GC doesn't run automatically, it has to be called by the user. Also, it won't release empty value frames and doesn't fully handle yet multiple frames. These issues will be fixed in the future releases.
